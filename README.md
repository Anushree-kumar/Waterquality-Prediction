# Waterquality-Prediction

### Introduction
A growing number of factors, including pollution, population expansion, and climate change, are putting the world's water resources in danger. How to obtain enough water to satisfy human demands while also conserving the integrity of aquatic ecosystems is a recurring concern as the world's population rises. The Pacific Institute works on global water resource issues in partnership with stakeholders to make sure that people and nature have access to the water they require to survive today and in the future.

### Dataset

### About the Dataset
This dataset consists of a train.csv file which contains the unique id id for each row, 6 category columns with suffix A to F, 9 feature columns with suffix A to I, 10 composition columns with suffix from A to J, unit column which is the unit of measurement of the result value and finally a result columns which is the measure of the quality of water as a numerical value to be predicted.

1.The category columns are various categorical features for a data point such as country of data collection, the site from which the data is collected, media of sample, etc.
2.The feature columns are the various demographic features that affect the pollution of water in a particular region such as population density, GDP, droughts in a region, literacy rate of students in a region, etc.
3.The composition columns are the compositions of various elements like paper, plastic wastes, cardboard, etc. in water.
4.The unit value is the unit of measurement in which the result value is measured.
5.The result value is a floating number that expresses the quality of water based on the various factors provided in the dataset.

### Objective
To train a machine learning model based on the water quality data provided and further predict the quality estimation.
